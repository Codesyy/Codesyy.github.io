    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <p1>Sorry for the horrible and bland design I am currently learning HTML. Anyways, Hi my name's Cody Tew. I am 15
      year old student who is passionate about programming and creating virtual applications. Although sometimes I feel
      a lose in motivation and scrap my projects. These include but are not limited to: VampireBot, PGB-Bot, Miyuki Bot
      and my involvment with the Asleius Gamedev Team. This website might find itself on this list but I hope it doesn't.
      Personal problems also come into a factor. I suffer from depression and this effects a lot of my life. I have lost
      and betrayed many people in the past and I have lied to gain attention from people I love and care about. (I am
      deeply sorry. You guys know who you are.) I have made up mental problems I had to get sympathy because I felt alone
      and needed the attention. I realise now how this wasn't the best of ideas because as soon as I was confronted I ran.
      I tried to run from my problems but it made me feel sick. I came clean and decided to become a better person and not
      lie about myself and that's where we are now. As I am writing this I am currently trying to become better. Anyways
      enough about my stupid past if you are here to contact me you can by emailing me at codytew03@gmail.com</p1>
